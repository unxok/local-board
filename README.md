# Local Board
This project aims to provide a simple and easy to use task management app that is highly customizable and completely local data.

## Task Management
As you may have guessed, the most prominent feature is that of offering boards with lanes and cards that can be added and reorganized.
I also plan to introduce some amount of table-view task management.

## Highly Customizable
Many resizable panels and aim to have every component able to be styled individually pretty much.

## Local Data
Your data for this website is only accessible by your device-- We have no servers or database to store it for you.
This does mean you may need to come up with a solution for transferring your saved data between your different devices and luckily it's easy enough to send an email with the file or the copied and pasted data.

## Portability
In the spirit of making sure your data is yours only, we plan to implement robust import/export processes to allow straghtforward conversions of your data on our site to and from CSV (and HTML?)
